## Photo Language Translation
by Saumya Gurtu for Systers, an Anita Borg Institute Community

This project aims at the development of a generic picture-dictionary kind of Ruby on Rails web application for PeaceCorps US volunteer sites (like Micronesia) in various countries to help in development of local languages which have no written script (eg. Chuukese). The volunteers and contributors can upload photos taken around town and add local language, its phonetic text and its English translation. The admin manages the registrations for volunteers and contributers and also manages various volunteer sites in a country.
